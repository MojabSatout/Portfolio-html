<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Hi! Iâ€™m Mojab, a Syrian design student in Dessau, 
  with focus on communication, digital and visual identity design. 
  As a designer, I tend to understand problems and systems for a 
  sustainble and effective solution. As a person, I find myself 
  somewhere between east and west, tradition and modern, 
  paper and pixels, <em>olive oil and chocolate.</em></h2>
